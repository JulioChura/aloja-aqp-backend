Hello. Let me introduce AlojaAQP.

AlojaAQP is a web platform created to make it easier for students to find accommodations near universities in Arequipa, Peru.

The main problem it solves is the lack of a centralized, reliable, and user-friendly system for searching, filtering, and comparing housing options close to campus.

Before AlojaAQP, students and property owners relied on scattered listings, social media, or word of mouth. This made the process inefficient, insecure, and time-consuming.

AlojaAQP solves this by providing a secure, modern, and feature-rich platform that connects students and property owners directly.

Let me highlight the main features:

- Advanced search and filtering for accommodations by price, number of rooms, services, and proximity to universities or campuses.
- User registration and authentication for both students and property owners, including Google login and national ID validation.
- Management of property listings: owners can publish, edit, hide, or delete their accommodations.
- Students can mark favorites, leave reviews, and view detailed information about each property.
- Integration with external services such as Cloudinary for image storage and Mapbox for geolocation and route calculation.
- Automatic API documentation and a modern, responsive frontend interface.

Now, about my role in the project:

Within the team, my main responsibility was to design the relational data model.
I also participated in the implementation of several backend modules, including accommodations, services, reviews, favorites, university distances, and related features.
Additionally, I contributed to the registration and authentication system, ensuring secure access and role-based features for both students and property owners.

On the frontend, I helped implement the “My Favorites” interface for students.
I also worked on integrating advanced filtering and search functionalities, and developing the dashboard visualization for property owners.
My focus was always on creating a seamless and intuitive user experience, and making sure the backend and frontend worked together smoothly.

Thank you for listening.
